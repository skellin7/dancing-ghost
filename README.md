#### Movement

* Click \& drag near the limb you wish to control to move the left/right wrists and ankles
* Hold the left/right arrow keys to play the left/right movement animations
* Use the W/A/S/D/ctrl/space keys to pan the camera



#### Cloth

* Settings on side allow rendering as vertices \& springs, normal-colored fabric, and texture-colored fabric
* Settings on side also control various other cloth properties







#### Known Bugs

* Individual limb control through mouse movement works unless camera/figure location is too far from origin, where mouse tracking calculations mean that target location is far off from actual desired location.
